# Database-and-Data-Modeling.

Database and Data Modeling provides the process of designing and managing databases through hands-on projects and assignments. This emphasizes the Database Development Lifecycle and the importance of creating efficient, scalable, and secure databases.

The project aims to develop Book Nook Library as a Library Management System featuring database architecture which enables efficient handling of numerous books and member profiles as well as tracks events. The system consists of features that enhance the tracking of inventory alongside the management of loans and the computation of fines.

The learning of entity relationships begins by using entity-relationship (ER) diagrams to establish system requirements precisely. The framework contains Book, Member, Loan, and Fine entities that include their connected attributes together with relations.

A normalization process should be used which moves from 1NF to 2NF and 3NF so customers can benefit from optimized database structure alongside redundant data elimination.

Through learning SQL Database Creation and Management students gain competence in SQL DDL command implementation for database setup and data insertion techniques with foreign key relationship establishment. The system will require database commands to handle loan management systems and fine procedures and membership controls.

The task of Report Development and Query Writing consists of developing SQL queries that produce analysis about overdue loans together with fine assessments and book inventory reports. The students will produce meaningful reporting outcomes by combining data across multiple tables through JOIN statements.

The physical aspect of database design will achieve library database implementation by creating tables for Books, Members, Loans, Fines, and Publishers which entails data type management and constraints and table relationships.

It covers SQL database security practices and database optimization techniques for secure operations and the improvement of query speeds when processing extensive datasets.
